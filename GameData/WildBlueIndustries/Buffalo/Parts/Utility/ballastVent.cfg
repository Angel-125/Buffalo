	description = Attach this vent to any container that holds intake liquid, and you can turn it into a ballast tank. The tank can be set up as a forward trim tank, aft trim tank, or for ballast. As a trim tank, it works with a dive computer to trim the boat until level in the water. You can also manually open and close the intakes as well as pump out the liquid- either slowly or rapidly.
