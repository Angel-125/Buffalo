	description = Extract valuable resources from the crusts of planets and asteroids by drilling into the ground. An internal auger moves the regolith to holding tanks for later processing. When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.
