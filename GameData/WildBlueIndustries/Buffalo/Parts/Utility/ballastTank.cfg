	description = This ballast tank can be filled with or emptied of intake liquid. The tank can be set up as a forward trim tank, aft trim tank, or for ballast. As a trim tank, it works with a dive computer to trim the boat until level in the water. You can also manually open and close the intakes as well as pump out the liquid- either slowly or rapidly.

	//NOTE: WBIBallastTank fills the part's IntakeLqd reserves WITHOUT using ModuleResourceIntake.
	//Why? Because ModuleResourceIntake will fill all the containers throughtout the vessel, and that's
	//not good for our tank, especially when we are trying to trim the boat. Plus, it's an extra part module
	//that requires attention by KSP, thus slowing it down. Similarly, we don't have another part module to
	//vent ballast for the same reason.

PART_TIP
{
	name = wbiBuffaloBallastTank
	description = The ballast tank can be set to Ballast to dive/surface the boat, or to Forward/Aft Trim to help level out the craft. It can be manually operated or work in conjunction with a dive computer. For the dive computer to operate correctly, the boat must have at least one forward and one aft trim tank in order to level the vessel. Trim tanks are still used to provide ballast as well.
