	description = A smaller version of Kerbodyne's mobile processing plant, this module can take raw materials containing even trace amounts of oxygen and hydrogen, and crack them into useful fuel products. While this smaller model is lighter than it's bigger cousin, it is less efficient, and not designed for long-term operations. These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating. Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat. This particular model was rebuilt from a prototype. It can be configured to produce a variety of different resources.
